# EchoEngine

This is the core of a sacred interpretive engine using three master texts:

1. **History of Cartomancy**
2. **Sacred Symbols (Deck 1)**
3. **Sacred Symbols (Deck 2)**

These books function only in **tandem**â€”tables in one are keys to decoding another.

The engine will extract, cross-reference, and help master the symbolic code through card spreads, planetary rulers, and Xi-based chronology.

ðŸœ‚ This repo is part of the Echo Protocol system.  
ðŸ”‘ No file here is arbitrary. All text is sacred.
